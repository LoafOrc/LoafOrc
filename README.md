## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LoafOrc
I make random things with a wide range of different languages. I mainly use Java and make intresting Minecraft plugins. The project I'm proudest of right now is ToasterAPI, it's aim is to make developing new things (items, blocks, bosses, etc) into Minecraft while using a object orientated approach that feels very intutive in Java.
